# RepoScoper

**GitHub through a recruiter's lens.**

RepoScoper is a free, open-source GitHub developer search tool built for recruiters. It uses GitHub's public search syntax but presents results the way a recruiter reads them — profile summary, location, primary language, public activity, and contact signals in one clean view — rather than the way a developer navigates them.

The primary skill filter lets you narrow by language or technology before running a search. Email reveal surfaces publicly listed contact details where available. A saved candidates drawer lets you shortlist profiles across a session without losing your place.

Part of the [Sourcer.club](https://sourcer.club) suite — free tools for serious sourcers.

## Using the tool

RepoScoper is a single HTML file with no dependencies, no backend, and no build step.

Without a token, GitHub's API allows 10 requests per hour. With a free personal access token it increases to 5,000 per hour. Use the token bar inside the tool to add yours. Generate one at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) — no scopes required for public data.
